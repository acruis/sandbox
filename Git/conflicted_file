This file tests what happens for this flow:

b1 -- c1 -- c2 --v
b2 -- c2 --^ -----??

(after c1, b1 merges from b2, then b2 merges from b1)

c1: append "c1" before '== base line =='
c2: append "c2" after '== base line =='

c1
== base line ==
c2

Result:
Merging b2 into b1 cannot be fast-forwarded, but merging b1 into b2 afterwards is fast-forwarded.
